This repository is a collection of sample projects which demonstrate my
computer programming skills.

1. ## api_hacker_news.py

  A. Requests library
  B. Making an API call and storing the response
  C. Try-except-else block
  D. Datetime library
  E. HTML links
  F. plotly.graph_objects

2. ## python_repos_visual.py

  B. Shapefiles
  C. US Census Bureau
  D. Bar Graphs
  E. Choropleths
  F. Folium
  G. Merging databases
  H. Manipulating JSON files
