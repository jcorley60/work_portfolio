#Tkinter works by starting a tcl/tk interpreter under the covers, and then translating
# tkinter commands into tcl/tk commands. The main window and this interpreter are
# intrinsically linked, and both are required for a tkinter application to work.

#Creating an instance of Tk initializes this interpreter and creates the root window.
# If you don't explicitly initialize it, one will be implicitly created when you create
# your first widget.

# I don't think there are any pitfalls by not initializing it yourself, but as the zen
# of python states, "explicit is better than implicit". Your code will be slightly
# easier to understand if you explicitly create the instance of Tk. It will, for instance,
# prevent other people from asking the same question about your code that you just asked
    # about this other code.
